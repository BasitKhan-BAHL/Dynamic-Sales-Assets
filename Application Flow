Application Flow (Based on User Story):
Here is the typical flow derived from the user story document:

Login: A Branch User or Help Desk User logs into the portal using their credentials (AHBS ID for Branch User).   

Dashboard View: Upon login, the user sees a dashboard summarizing leads by status (e.g., Total Assigned Leads, Convert to Client, Under Follow up, New Leads). These dashboard sections likely link to relevant views/actions.   

Lead Generation (Branch User):
A Branch User initiates lead generation for either NTB (New To Bank) or ETB (Existing To Bank) customers.
For ETB leads, selecting "Existing Customer" in Lead Avenue displays the Account Number and Account Title fields.   
The user fills in the detailed customer information, including the newly added fields like Customer Type, Visit Purpose, Persons Met, Classification, etc., using dropdowns (LOVs) where applicable.   
The user can Save the lead (remains editable by the user) or Save & Submit. Both actions make the lead visible in reports for both user roles.   

Activity Management (Branch User):
The Branch User can select a lead (e.g., from the dashboard or a search) to view its details and record activities.   
The user records the Activity Date time (cannot be past/future), Activity description, Action Result, and updates the Lead Status.   

Status-Specific Actions:
Converted to Client: User must enter the Opened_Account_Number and the system fetches/validates the Account_Title. Comments are required.   
Under Follow-up: User must select a Next Action (Call, Email, Visit), set a Next Follow up Date Time (future date allowed), and add comments.   
Closed: User must select a reason from the Close Remarks LOV and provide details in the reasoning field.   

Printing Visit Report: From the activity screen for a selected lead, the user has an option to print the captured lead/customer information.   

Reporting (Branch User & Help Desk User):
Both user roles can access a reporting section to view and download lead data.   
Reports include the newly added customer information fields.   
Downloads are available in Excel and PDF formats.   

Date filters have restrictions: generally only the previous 30 days, but for "Under Follow-up" status, users can also search up to 30 days in the future.   

Help Desk User Functions: This role primarily focuses on viewing the dashboard and generating/viewing reports. They do not perform lead generation or activity logging.
